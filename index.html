               <h2>Taal Volcano and Lake</h2>
               <p>
                  Locals and foreign visitors from Manila often take a quick
                  escape from the megacity and make their way down south to
                  Tagaytay, a relaxing town famous for its cool weather,
                  magnificent views, and many tourist spots. The best views face
                  Taal Volcano, the world’s smallest active volcano. The volcano
                  sits on an island within a lake within an island. If that is
                  not interesting enough, you can actually hike up to the
                  volcano crater with excursions to Taal Volcano.

                  Travel back in time as you stroll along the streets of Calle
                  Crisologo in Vigan. This 16th-century town, a UNESCO World
                  Heritage Site, quietly boasts old-world charm and Spanish
                  colonial architecture and is the top attraction in Vigan,
                  Ilocos tours. The town has successfully managed to preserve
                  the historic district where you can still find calesas
                  (horse-drawn carriages).

                  El Nido in Palawan is most famous for its paradise-like
                  islands and lagoons, but a 45-minute ride away through a land
                  tour from its main town takes you to another idyllic
                  destination: Nacpan Beach.

               <h2>Tubbataha Reef</h2>
               <p>
                  Tubbataha Reef is regarded as one of the top diving spots in
                  the Philippines, and perhaps, the world. Located at the heart
                  of the Sulu Sea, it is considered a center of marine
                  biodiversity and a haven not just for divers but marine
                  conservationists as well. The only way to get to this marine
                  sanctuary is through a liveaboard vessel from Puerto Princesa,
                  Palawan.

               <h2>Mayon Volcano</h2>
               <p>
                  As soon as your flight lands at the airport in Legazpi City,
                  the world’s most perfect volcanic cone, and the most active
                  volcano in the Philippines, greets you with its majesty. Mayon
                  Volcano is one of the most beautiful places to visit in the
                  Philippines and is a top attraction in any Bicol tour. Its
                  sheer beauty (the name Mayon comes from the Bicolano word
                  ‘magayon,’ which means beautiful) hides a violent core, with
                  past eruptions that flattened several towns.

               <h2>Intramuros and Fort Santiago</h2>
               <p>
                  Take a stroll through history lane within the walled city of
                  Intramuros in Manila. This 64-hectare Spanish fortress was
                  erected by Miguel Lopez de Legazpi and was destroyed by the
                  end of World War II. However, the ruins remain very alive
                  today and can be explored via Intramuros tours. The area has
                  become home to several universities and establishments. You
                  can find centuries-old churches like the grand Manila
                  Cathedral and San Agustin Church, the oldest church in the
                  Philippines.
